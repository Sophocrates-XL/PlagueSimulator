DEMOGRAPHIC SPECIFICATIONS:
# Population: The total number of individuals simulated.

PLAGUE SPECIFICATIONS:
# Infection rate: The probability of transmission each tick. Corresponds to the rate K in S + I -> I + I.
# Appearance rate: The probability of an incubant person shows symptoms each tick.
# Recovery rate: The probability of recovery of a symptomatic patient each tick.
# Death rate: The probability of death of a symptomatic patient each tick.
# Acquired immunity: Determines if a recovered individual can be reinfected.

POLICY SPECIFICATIONS:
# Motion rate: The probability that an individual moves each tick.
# Teleport rate: The probability that an individual takes a transport each tick.
# Discovery rate: The probability that a symptomatic individual will be discovered by the healthcare.
# Cure rate: The probability that an individual is cured each tick.
# Patient capacity: The maximum number of patients that can be treated simultaneously.

LOGICAL FLOW OF INFECTION:
1. A susceptible individual acquires the disease and enters the incubation state. [ Infectivity ]
2. The incubation state gradually transits to the symptomatic state. [ Appearance rate ]
3. A symptomatic individual is identified by the healthcare system. [ Discovery rate. Patient capacity. ]
4. A symptomatic individual either remains as such, or recovers, or dies. Hospitalization substantially
increases recovery and reduces death. [ Recovery rate. Death rate. Hospitalization status ]
5. A recovered patient may or may not be reinfected. [ Acquired immunity. ]








POLICIES:
# Prohibit transport: Individuals will not be teleported randomly on the map.
# Restrict movement: Individuals are 90% less likely to move around.
# Safe distance: Individuals are 50% less likely to approach other individuals.


TILE TYPES:
# Passables: Valid locations where a person may move to and where teleport points may be set.
# Unpassables: Invalid movement or teleport locations.

SIMULATION ELEMENTS:
# Persons: Randomly moves about. Teleports themselves to random destinations on teleport points.
# Quarantine zones: Delineates a rectangular area where no movement or transmission can traverse its borders.
# Teleport points: Instantaneously teleports a person to another random teleport point.

MOUSE CONTROLS:
# Left mouse button: Click, drag over the screen and unclick to create a rectangular quarantine zone.
# Right mouse button: Click to visualize asymptomatic cases. Unclick to hide asymptomatic cases.

KEYBOARD CONTROLS:
# T: Toggles transport restriction status. In transport restriction, all teleport points will be disabled.
# M: Toggles movement restriction status. In movement restriction, all people are 90% less likely to move.
